# QAIS - Quantum Artificial Intelligence Suite  
**Your Gateway to Quantum Neural Networks**  

## What is QAIS?  
QAIS (**Quantum Artificial Intelligence Suite**) is an open-source project designed to **simplify Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)** for developers and hobbyists. It provides **practical examples** and resources to make Quantum AI more accessible.  

## Purpose  
QAIS aims to **lower the barrier to entry** for Quantum AI by:  
- Providing **clear, hands-on QNN examples** to help developers get started.  
- Offering **framework-agnostic learning**, beginning with Qiskit and expanding over time.  
- Building a **community-driven ecosystem** where collaboration fuels innovation.  

## Looking Ahead  
QAIS will continue to grow with **more examples, tools, and expanded framework support** as the Quantum AI landscape evolves.  

## Join the Community  
QAIS is **open-source**, and contributions are welcome! Stay tuned for updates and ways to get involved.
